Description: In this analysis, we developed a linear regression model to predict student salaries based on their CGPA using a placement dataset. Linear regression, a key statistical technique, models the relationship between a dependent variable (salary) and an independent variable (CGPA) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. Initially, we performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure appropriate data types. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the distributions of CGPA and salary, revealing that while CGPA followed a normal distribution, salary was right-skewed, indicating a wide range of starting salaries. A scatter plot of CGPA versus salary suggested a positive linear relationship. Using Python’s scikit-learn library, we built the linear regression model by splitting the data into training and testing sets. The model was trained on the training set, where it learned the coefficients that best describe the data. The regression coefficient quantified the relationship between CGPA and salary, indicating the expected change in salary for a one-unit increase in CGPA. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared, which provided insights into the model’s accuracy and goodness of fit. This analysis highlights the significant predictive power of CGPA in determining student salaries, providing valuable insights for students and educational institutions alike.

Conclusion: The linear regression model developed to predict student salaries based on CGPA demonstrated a significant positive relationship between these two variables. Through careful data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis, we established that higher CGPAs are generally associated with higher starting salaries. The model, built using Python’s scikit-learn library and evaluated through metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared, showed good predictive performance, affirming the importance of academic performance in influencing placement outcomes. This analysis underscores the value of CGPA as a key indicator of potential earnings for students, providing actionable insights for both students aiming to maximize their earning potential and educational institutions looking to support their students’ career aspirations. By highlighting the impact of academic achievement on salary outcomes, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the factors driving employment success and financial returns for graduates.
